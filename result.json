Mukhtar was captured and sent to gallows by the Italians.\n\nOmar al-Mukhtar's famous dying words in 1931 after the rope he was hung with broke: Italy is as weak as its ropes. His executioners were Italian Fascists who met an ignominious end, while Mukhtar's legacy lives on.\n\nOmar is remembered as the Qur'an teacher who led by example and fought the occupiers to the death. Less known is that he was also a Sufi, and a humanist who abided by the Medina ethical code of war unlike his Fascist opponents.\n\nOmar al-Mukhtar's status as a high symbol of resistance is a result of his absolute refusal to abandon his cause despite his old age and numerous attempts to bribe him. His view was: We don't belong in Italy, and Italy doesn't belong here."

Built during Prophet Muhammad’s ﷺ lifetime, this landmark building is among the most important of India’s historic, architecturally stunning mosques.\n\nMalik Bin Dinar, one of the first propagators of Islam to have come to the Indian subcontinent, built the Cheraman Jama Masjid. Among the many stories in circulation about the mosque’s origins, the most popular recounts how Cheraman Perumal, the region’s king, gave up his throne to embrace Islam and make a pilgrimage to Makkah. After years spent in Makka, the king decided to return home but fell ill and died on the way. However, Malik Bin Dinar and his companions completed the king’s journey on his behalf. They carried with them a series of letters written by Cheraman Perumal asking local rulers of Kerala for their permission to build the area’s first mosques."

   "text": "Miya Muhammad Bakhsh (d.1907) was an outstanding Sufi poet hailing from Mirpur, Kashmir. He is especially renowned as the author of a book of poetry called Sayf al-Muluk, his magnum opus, which is a story of a Prince with strong Sufi undertones. He also also Masnavi nayrang-i Ishq (re-working of Mevlana Rumi's Masnavi). \n\nMiya Muhammad Bakhsh received his early education at home and was later sent with his elder brother, Mīān Bahāval, to the nearby village of Samwal Sharīf to study religious sciences, especially the science of Hadith in the madrassah of Hāfiz Muhammad 'Alī. \n\nHis poetry is essentially written in a mixed language composed of standard Punjabi and the Pothohari and Hinko dialects of Punjabi, and utilizes a rich vocabulary of Persian and Arabic words. Miya Muhammad Bakhsh, in his lifetime, contributed his great mystic thought in the language of the masses – Punjabi language which was also his mother tongue. He remained a celibate and passed away peacefully at an advanced age."
